## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not create a public issue**.

Please report it privately via email to: [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com)

- Include as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, browser version, screenshots, etc.).
- We will acknowledge your report and once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will prepare a dedicated fix as timely as possible.
- We will keep you informed of progress and notify you when the issue is resolved.
